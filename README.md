# 📚 Sci-Fi Reading Tracker

This is a project to track the science fiction books I read.  
All books are stored in a JSON file (`data/libri.json`), and an automated workflow generates a bar chart with my ratings.  

The chart is rebuilt by **GitHub Actions** whenever the JSON file changes, and it is published on **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 🔧 How it works

- **Data** → `data/libri.json` contains the list of books with title, author, year, saga, and rating (0–5).
- **Script** → `scripts/genera_grafico.py` reads the JSON, sorts the data, and generates a chart with Seaborn + Matplotlib.
- **Automation** → `.github/workflows/update-graph.yml` runs the script on every push that modifies the JSON.
- **Output** → the updated chart (`docs/grafico.png`) is published on GitHub Pages along with a minimal HTML page.
