# Sci-Fi Reading Tracker

This project tracks the science fiction books I've read, along with a personal rating from 0 to 5 that I've assigned to each of them.

The book information is stored in a JSON file (`data/book_list.json`). A bar chart is generated from this data using a Python script with Seaborn + Matplotlib.

The chart is automatically rebuilt via a GitHub Actions workflow whenever the JSON file changes, and it is published on GitHub Pages.

## How it works

- **Data** → `data/book_list.json` contains the list of books with title, author, year, saga, and rating (0–5)
- **Script** → `scripts/graph_generator.py` reads the JSON, sorts the data, and generates a chart with Seaborn + Matplotlib
- **Automation** → `.github/workflows/update-graph.yml` runs the script on every push that modifies the JSON
- **Output** → the updated chart (`docs/graph.png`) is published on GitHub Pages along with a minimal HTML page


Books are displayed like this:

- Title + author and year on the left
- Rating as a horizontal bar (0–5 scale)
- Missing ratings are marked in red as *“Voto mancante”* ('Missing rating')
